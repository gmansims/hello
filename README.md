# hello

This is a test repo. I am using this to learn:
    1. How GitHub works. I will use git commands from teh terminal. Complete!
    
    2. How VS Code works.
    3. How to code in Pyhton.
    4. How to "vibe code" with Claude Code.

My tech stack is:
    1. VS Code for IDE
    2. Connected to GitHub for source control.
    3. Connected to Claude Code for coding help.

This is as of January 29, 2026. I may post updates on a semi-regular basis.

I also plan to create a website with a similar tech stack down the road.
